# efficient-frontier
A C++ application for analyzing the efficient frontier of a set of stocks

## Components \[To Do\]

### 1. Data

**Objective** - Retrieve data on a (list of) stock(s) for a specified time period. If data does not exist for the given time period, throw an error.

### 2. Data Processing

**Objective** - Store adjusted close data for stocks in an object (C++ Class) and be able to flexibly run calculations on said object(s).

### 3. Optimization

**Objective** - Given a set of "stock"-objects, efficiently compute solutions to Markowitz's Mean/Variance portfolio optimization model. With the given set of solutions, provide data that describes the efficient frontier

### 4. Visualization

**Objective** - Visualize the efficient frontier data.
